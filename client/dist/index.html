								<li class="list-group-item">Throughtout the game players compete against each other to
									claim markers that are inbetween
									them. To do this,
									during a player's turn, player takes a card from the hand and puts it in one of the
									zones. This
									card cannot be moved any more.
									Then next card from player's deck will be added to his/hers hand and may be played
									in next
									round.
									When both players play 3 cards to one zone the player who created better formation
									claims the
									marker.
									Those formations are similar to those found in poker and have the similar priority.
									Those
									formations are explained <a class="link-danger"
										href="#formationExplanation">below</a>.
									If two formations are identical, player that created his/hers formation first claims
									the marker.
									Note: It is possible to claim a marker before the opponent places 3 cards, but only
									if it can be
									proven that opponent's
									formation would not be able to beat player's combination of cards (no matter what
									card would be
									played next).</li>
